## Other repositories of note

[`t-funk`](https://github.com/Bevy-Rust-GPU/t-funk)

Type-level programming toolkit. Abuses Rust's type system to encode composable compile-time computation.
Implements data structures, type classes, and a significant chunk of the Haskell standard library - all at the type level.

Pros: Rich expression of compile-time computation at the type level.
Cons: Wordy. Terrible compile times.
